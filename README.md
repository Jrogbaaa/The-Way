# The Way: Content AI Agent

A cutting-edge platform that empowers content creators with AI-powered tools to optimize their social media content.

## Recent Updates (July/August 2024)

- **Enhanced Google Authentication Flow**: Fixed and improved the Google OAuth authentication process:
  - Fixed profile display issues in the Navbar for Google-authenticated users
  - Implemented timeout mechanism to prevent hanging during OAuth redirects
  - Enhanced Navbar rendering to properly display user info regardless of loading state
  - Added fallback user data display from Google metadata when profile fetch fails

- **Image Optimization Feature**: Added an image optimization step to the Social Media Post Analyzer. Users can now automatically crop/resize uploaded images to recommended aspect ratios (e.g., 9:16 for TikTok/Reels/Stories) directly after analysis.
- **Text-to-Image Generator & Models Page Restructure**: Added a standard Text-to-Image generator (using SDXL) on its own dedicated page (`/generate/image`). Restructured the main Models page (`/models`) to separate models into "Standard Models" (Text-to-Image, Image-to-Video) and "Custom Trained Models" (Cristina, Jaime, Bea) sections for clarity, and updated the model link.
- **UI Consistency & Model Images**: Unified the header styling (title font, color gradient, container rounding) between the Gallery and Creator Gallery pages for a more consistent look and feel. Updated the preview images for the Bea, Cristina, and Jaime models on the Creator Gallery page with new provided photos.
- **Gallery Upload and Display Enhancements**: Improved the gallery functionality with several key updates:
  - Added robust image upload to Supabase storage with proper authentication
  - Implemented automatic gallery refresh after successful uploads
  - Created a manual refresh button with loading indicator
  - Enhanced the UI with better error handling and feedback
  - Added a "no images" state with guidance for new users
  - Optimized gallery display for various device sizes

- **Authentication Bypass Development Mode**: Added temporary authentication bypass to simplify development and testing. This includes:
  - Added a middleware file (`src/middleware.ts`) that bypasses authentication checks.
  - Created a mock user in the auth store (`src/lib/store/index.ts`) to prevent client-side authentication redirects.
  - These changes allow developers to access all pages without authentication during development.

- **Next.js Image Configuration**: Extended the `next.config.mjs` file to allow additional remote image domains, specifically adding `i.pravatar.cc` to the `remotePatterns` array to fix the error: "Invalid src prop on `next/image`, hostname is not configured under images in your `next.config.js`".

- **Content Suggestions UI Enhancement**: The A/B Testing Content Suggestions component now displays actual images (or relevant placeholders from Unsplash) instead of text previews, providing a better visual experience. This required creating `next.config.mjs` to configure allowed remote image domains.
- **Stability AI Inpainting API Tuning**: Adjusted API parameters (`strength`, `cfg_scale`, `model`) and fixed parameter names (`mask`) in the `/api/stability/inpaint` route handler to improve inpainting results.
- **Replicate API Fixes**: Ensured the `/api/replicate/predictions/[id]` route handler correctly handles asynchronous operations for polling prediction status.
- **API Key Security**: Verified that the Stability AI API key (`STABILITY_AI_API_KEY`) is correctly handled server-side and not exposed to the client.
- **Code Quality**: Fixed various TypeScript type errors identified by the validation script, improving overall code stability.

## Authentication & Access

This application uses NextAuth.js (Auth.js) for user authentication, primarily leveraging Google OAuth for sign-in and sign-up.

### NextAuth.js Implementation

The application is configured to use NextAuth.js for authentication with the following setup:

1. **Configuration**: The auth system is configured in `src/auth.config.ts` which defines the Google provider and callback handlers.
2. **API Routes**: Authentication endpoints are exposed at `/api/auth/*` and are handled by the API route in `src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts`.
3. **Login/Signup Pages**: Custom login and signup pages located at `/auth/login` and `/auth/signup` that use the NextAuth.js `signIn` function for authentication.
4. **Session Management**: The `SessionProvider` in `src/components/AuthProvider.tsx` provides session information throughout the application.
5. **Protected Routes**: The middleware in `src/middleware.ts` checks authentication status and redirects unauthenticated users from protected routes.

### Environment Variables

To configure authentication, you need to set up the following environment variables in your `.env.local` file:

```
# NextAuth.js Configuration
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000                # Use your deployment URL in production
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-strong-secret-key-here       # Generate with: openssl rand -base64 32

# Google OAuth Provider
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-client-secret
```

**For Vercel deployment:**
Make sure to add these environment variables in your Vercel project settings.

### Google OAuth Setup

1. Create a project in the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Configure the OAuth consent screen
3. Create OAuth credentials (Web application type)
4. Add your app's domains to the authorized JavaScript origins:
   - `http://localhost:3000` for local development
   - `https://your-production-domain.com` for production
5. Add the following authorized redirect URIs:
   - `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google` for local development
   - `https://your-production-domain.com/api/auth/callback/google` for production
6. Copy the generated Client ID and Client Secret to your environment variables

### User Session and Data Access

When a user is authenticated:
- The session object contains the user's basic information (name, email, image)
- The user ID is available as `session.user.id` for database queries
- Protected API routes can verify authentication using the `auth()` function

### Accessing User Session

In client components:
```tsx
'use client';
import { useAuthUser } from '@/hooks/useAuthUser';

export default function MyComponent() {
  const { user, isLoading, isAuthenticated } = useAuthUser();
  
  if (isLoading) return <div>Loading...</div>;
  if (!isAuthenticated) return <div>Not authenticated</div>;
  
  return <div>Hello {user.name}</div>;
}
```

In server components:
```tsx
import { auth } from '@/auth';

export default async function MyServerComponent() {
  const session = await auth();
  
  if (!session) {
    return <div>Not authenticated</div>;
  }
  
  return <div>Hello {session.user.name}</div>;
}
```

## Storyboard-to-Video System

The storyboard-to-video system allows users to:

1. Create personalized AI models of themselves
2. Generate consistent AI photos as key frames in a storyboard
3. Define a narrative flow with shot descriptions
4. Automatically generate intermediate frames
5. Compile into smooth, long-form video content

### Key Concept

The system generates "keyframe" images at approximately 2-second intervals using personalized AI models, then uses video generation to create smooth motion between these consistent frames, resulting in cohesive longer-form videos where characters maintain visual consistency.

### User Flow

1. User creates personalized AI model (using existing infrastructure)
2. User defines storyboard sequence with text descriptions for each scene
3. System generates consistent keyframe images for each scene using personalized models
4. User reviews, adjusts, and approves keyframes
5. System processes approved keyframes to create interpolated video
6. User receives final video with options to edit or regenerate segments

### Technical Implementation

The storyboard-to-video system consists of several key components:

1. **Storyboard Creator**: Interface for creating and managing storyboards
2. **Character Consistency Management**: System for maintaining character consistency across frames
3. **Keyframe Generation API**: Endpoints for generating consistent keyframe images
4. **Video Interpolation System**: Service for creating smooth transitions between keyframes
5. **Timeline Component**: UI for visualizing and organizing scenes
6. **Video Processing Engine**: Backend for compiling keyframes into a final video

### Database Schema

The system uses the following database tables:

- `storyboards`: Main table for storyboard projects
- `scenes`: Individual scenes within a storyboard
- `storyboard_characters`: Characters used in storyboards
- `scene_characters`: Junction table for characters in specific scenes
- `videos`: Generated videos from storyboards

### API Endpoints

- `/api/storyboard/generate-keyframe`: Generate a keyframe image for a scene
- `/api/storyboard/generate-video`: Process keyframes into a final video

### Character Consistency

The system uses several techniques to maintain character consistency:

1. Feature extraction from personalized AI models
2. Enhanced prompts with character-specific details
3. Optional consistency analysis and enforcement

### Video Generation

Video generation occurs in two main steps:

1. Keyframe generation with consistent characters and settings
2. Frame interpolation between keyframes to create smooth motion

The system supports integration with multiple video interpolation services:

- Runway Gen-2
- D-ID
- Custom interpolation solutions

### Usage

To access the storyboard creator, navigate to:

```
/storyboard-creator
```

For more detailed documentation on the storyboard system, see the [Storyboard Documentation](./the-way/docs/storyboard.md).

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Check that your environment variables are correctly set in `.env.local`
2. Ensure that you're running the application from the correct directory
3. Verify API keys and service account credentials are valid
4. Run the environment check script: `node -r dotenv/config scripts/check-env.js`
5. See documentation in the `docs/` directory for specific services

### Authentication Bypass for Development

The application includes a development mode that bypasses authentication checks:

- The middleware (`src/middleware.ts`) is configured to bypass authentication restrictions
- A mock user is provided in the auth store (`src/lib/store/index.ts`) to prevent client-side redirects
- This allows developers to access all pages without proper authentication during development
- To restore authentication:
  - Remove or disable the middleware implementation
  - Reset the auth store to use `null` as the default user state
  - Restart the development server

### Next.js Image Configuration

If you encounter errors with remote images like `Invalid src prop on next/image, hostname is not configured`:

1. Check which remote domain is causing the issue in the error message
2. Open `next.config.mjs` and add the domain to the `remotePatterns` array
3. Follow the existing pattern for domains like `i.pravatar.cc`, `images.unsplash.com`, and `replicate.delivery`.
4. Restart the development server after making changes

## Deployment

### Vercel Deployment

The application is deployed using [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). The deployment process is automated through GitHub integration.

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel
3. Configure the required environment variables in Vercel dashboard:
   - All the environment variables listed in the `.env.example` file

For manual deployment, use:

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm install -g vercel

# Login to Vercel
vercel login

# Deploy to production
vercel --prod
```

### Environment Variables

Ensure all required environment variables are set in the Vercel dashboard:

- `GEMINI_API_KEY` - Google Gemini API key for chat functionality
- `GOOGLE_API_KEY` - Google API key for other Google services
- `VERTEX_AI_LOCATION` - Location for Vertex AI services (e.g., us-central1)
- `GOOGLE_CLOUD_VISION_CREDENTIALS` - Base64 encoded Google Vision credentials
- `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID` - Google Cloud project ID
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` - Supabase URL
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - Supabase anonymous key
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` - Supabase service role key
- `REPLICATE_API_TOKEN` - Replicate API token
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` - Public URL of your application

For detailed information about each environment variable, see `.env.example`.

### Google Credentials

For Google Cloud services (Vertex AI, Vision API), you need to handle the credentials file:

1. Generate a service account key from Google Cloud Console
2. For Vercel deployment, base64 encode the JSON file:
   ```bash
   cat google-credentials.json | base64
   ```
3. Store the encoded string in the `GOOGLE_CLOUD_VISION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable
4. The application automatically decodes this string during runtime

## Maintaining Application Functionality

To ensure the application remains functional and stable during development, follow these maintenance guidelines:

### Git Workflow & Push Frequency

- **Commit frequently, push strategically**
  - Make small, focused commits with clear messages
  - Push completed features or bug fixes, not partial implementations
  - Use descriptive branch names for features/fixes (e.g., `fix/image-api-connection`)
  - Run the pre-push validation script before pushing: `node scripts/pre-push-check.js`

- **Recommended push frequency**
  - Push at natural completion points (feature complete, tests pass)
  - Push at least once daily when actively developing
  - Always push before stepping away from a project for more than a day

### API Stability & Error Handling

- **Error boundaries**
  - Use the `ErrorBoundary` component for catching runtime errors
  - Add specific error boundaries around components that interact with external APIs
  - Example: `<ErrorBoundary><YourComponent /></ErrorBoundary>`

- **API error fallbacks**
  - For image generation, implement fallback images when APIs fail
  - For data fetching, include default/cached data as fallbacks
  - Add retry logic for transient API failures

- **Environment variable management**
  - Always check that API keys and endpoints are correctly configured
  - Update `.env.example` when adding new environment variables
  - Document required API permissions in the appropriate documentation

### Route Management

- **Handling route changes**
  - When changing route paths, add redirects for old routes
  - Update the `ROUTES` object in `src/lib/config.ts`
  - Update any hardcoded references to routes in components

- **Testing routes**
  - Verify that all routes in the navigation components work
  - Test deep links and direct URL access
  - Confirm redirect paths function correctly

### Testing Protocols

- **Before each commit**
  - Manually test affected components
  - Verify API integrations still function
  - Check for visual regressions

- **Before each push**
  - Run TypeScript type checking: `npx tsc --noEmit`
  - Run ESLint: `npm run lint`
  - Run pre-push validation script: `node scripts/pre-push-check.js`

- **After API changes**
  - Test all features that use the modified API
  - Verify error handling works as expected
  - Document any changes in behavior

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **API Connection Errors**
  - Check environment variables are correctly set
  - Verify API keys are valid and have required permissions
  - Test API endpoints directly with tools like Postman
  - Check for CORS issues in browser developer tools

- **React Component Errors**
  - Use React DevTools to inspect component state
  - Check prop types and required props
  - Look for state update issues on unmounted components

- **Route/Navigation Issues**
  - Verify route is correctly defined in ROUTES object
  - Check if the page component exists at the expected path
  - Ensure layout components are properly wrapping content

## Local Development with ComfyUI Integration

The application now supports local image editing using ComfyUI, providing faster processing and more privacy compared to cloud-based solutions.

### Setting up ComfyUI

1. **Install ComfyUI**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI
   cd ComfyUI
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Download Required Models**:
   - Download an inpainting model like `sd_xl_turbo_1.0_fp16.safetensors` or `sd-v1-5-inpainting.ckpt`
   - Place the model in the `ComfyUI/models/checkpoints` directory

3. **Start ComfyUI**:
   ```bash
   cd ComfyUI
   python main.py
   ```
   ComfyUI will start on `http://127.0.0.1:8188` by default

4. **Using ComfyUI in The Way**:
   - After uploading an image in The Way app, select "ComfyUI Inpaint" from the editing options
   - Draw a mask over the area you want to modify
   - Enter a prompt describing what should appear in the masked area
   - Click "Generate with ComfyUI" to process locally

### Troubleshooting

- Ensure ComfyUI is running before attempting local inpainting
- Check the browser console and server logs for any errors
- Verify that the models are correctly placed in the ComfyUI directories
- Make sure you have enough GPU memory for processing

## Supabase Storage Setup

The application uses Supabase Storage for file uploads in the Gallery feature. To ensure proper functionality, you need to set up the required storage buckets and RLS (Row Level Security) policies.

### Manual Setup in Supabase Dashboard

1. Log in to your Supabase dashboard
2. Go to "Storage" in the left sidebar
3. Create a new bucket named `gallery-uploads` with public access enabled
4. Set up the following RLS policies for the bucket:
   - **INSERT**: Allow authenticated users to upload to their own directory
     - `auth.uid() = (storage.foldername)[1]::uuid`
   - **SELECT**: Allow anyone to view files (for public gallery)
     - `true`
   - **UPDATE**: Allow users to update their own files
     - `auth.uid() = (storage.foldername)[1]::uuid`
   - **DELETE**: Allow users to delete their own files
     - `auth.uid() = (storage.foldername)[1]::uuid`

### Automatic Setup with Script

Alternatively, you can use the provided setup script to configure storage:

```bash
# Make sure you have the required environment variables in .env
# NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
# SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY

# Run the setup script
node scripts/setup-supabase-storage.js
```

### Troubleshooting Uploads

If you encounter "401 Unauthorized" errors when uploading:

1. Ensure you have a valid, active session by signing in
2. Check that the storage bucket exists in your Supabase project
3. Verify that appropriate RLS policies are configured
4. Check browser console and API logs for specific error messages

### Storage Path Structure

Files in the gallery are stored with the following pattern:

```
gallery-uploads/[user_id]/[timestamp]-[filename]
```

This structure works with the RLS policies to ensure users can only upload to their own directory.

### Gallery Improvements (Latest)
- Added drag and drop functionality for moving images between folders
- Enhanced folder navigation with clearer visual hierarchy 
- Separated folders and images into distinct sections
- Improved folder view UI with larger, more prominent folder titles
- Fixed Supabase storage authentication issues
- Implemented proper error handling for storage operations
