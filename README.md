## Storyboard-to-Video System

The storyboard-to-video system allows users to:

1. Create personalized AI models of themselves
2. Generate consistent AI photos as key frames in a storyboard
3. Define a narrative flow with shot descriptions
4. Automatically generate intermediate frames
5. Compile into smooth, long-form video content

### Key Concept

The system generates "keyframe" images at approximately 2-second intervals using personalized AI models, then uses video generation to create smooth motion between these consistent frames, resulting in cohesive longer-form videos where characters maintain visual consistency.

### User Flow

1. User creates personalized AI model (using existing infrastructure)
2. User defines storyboard sequence with text descriptions for each scene
3. System generates consistent keyframe images for each scene using personalized models
4. User reviews, adjusts, and approves keyframes
5. System processes approved keyframes to create interpolated video
6. User receives final video with options to edit or regenerate segments

### Technical Implementation

The storyboard-to-video system consists of several key components:

1. **Storyboard Creator**: Interface for creating and managing storyboards
2. **Character Consistency Management**: System for maintaining character consistency across frames
3. **Keyframe Generation API**: Endpoints for generating consistent keyframe images
4. **Video Interpolation System**: Service for creating smooth transitions between keyframes
5. **Timeline Component**: UI for visualizing and organizing scenes
6. **Video Processing Engine**: Backend for compiling keyframes into a final video

### Database Schema

The system uses the following database tables:

- `storyboards`: Main table for storyboard projects
- `scenes`: Individual scenes within a storyboard
- `storyboard_characters`: Characters used in storyboards
- `scene_characters`: Junction table for characters in specific scenes
- `videos`: Generated videos from storyboards

### API Endpoints

- `/api/storyboard/generate-keyframe`: Generate a keyframe image for a scene
- `/api/storyboard/generate-video`: Process keyframes into a final video

### Character Consistency

The system uses several techniques to maintain character consistency:

1. Feature extraction from personalized AI models
2. Enhanced prompts with character-specific details
3. Optional consistency analysis and enforcement

### Video Generation

Video generation occurs in two main steps:

1. Keyframe generation with consistent characters and settings
2. Frame interpolation between keyframes to create smooth motion

The system supports integration with multiple video interpolation services:

- Runway Gen-2
- D-ID
- Custom interpolation solutions

### Usage

To access the storyboard creator, navigate to:

```
/storyboard-creator
```

For more detailed documentation on the storyboard system, see the [Storyboard Documentation](./docs/storyboard.md).

## Deployment

### Vercel Deployment

The application is deployed using [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). The deployment process is automated through GitHub integration.

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel
3. Configure the required environment variables in Vercel dashboard:
   - All the environment variables listed in the `.env.example` file

For manual deployment, use:

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm install -g vercel

# Login to Vercel
vercel login

# Deploy to production
vercel --prod
```

### Environment Variables

Ensure all required environment variables are set in the Vercel dashboard:

- `GEMINI_API_KEY` - Google Gemini API key for chat functionality
- `GOOGLE_API_KEY` - Google API key for other Google services
- `VERTEX_AI_LOCATION` - Location for Vertex AI services (e.g., us-central1)
- `GOOGLE_CLOUD_VISION_CREDENTIALS` - Base64 encoded Google Vision credentials
- `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID` - Google Cloud project ID
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` - Supabase URL
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - Supabase anonymous key
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` - Supabase service role key
- `REPLICATE_API_TOKEN` - Replicate API token
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` - Public URL of your application

For detailed information about each environment variable, see `.env.example`.

### Google Credentials

For Google Cloud services (Vertex AI, Vision API), you need to handle the credentials file:

1. Generate a service account key from Google Cloud Console
2. For Vercel deployment, base64 encode the JSON file:
   ```bash
   cat google-credentials.json | base64
   ```
3. Store the encoded string in the `GOOGLE_CLOUD_VISION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable
4. The application automatically decodes this string during runtime
