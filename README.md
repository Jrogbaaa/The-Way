## Deployment

### Vercel Deployment

The application is deployed using [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). The deployment process is automated through GitHub integration.

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel
3. Configure the required environment variables in Vercel dashboard:
   - All the environment variables listed in the `.env.example` file

For manual deployment, use:

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm install -g vercel

# Login to Vercel
vercel login

# Deploy to production
vercel --prod
```

### Environment Variables

Ensure all required environment variables are set in the Vercel dashboard:

- `GEMINI_API_KEY` - Google Gemini API key for chat functionality
- `GOOGLE_API_KEY` - Google API key for other Google services
- `VERTEX_AI_LOCATION` - Location for Vertex AI services (e.g., us-central1)
- `GOOGLE_CLOUD_VISION_CREDENTIALS` - Base64 encoded Google Vision credentials
- `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID` - Google Cloud project ID
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` - Supabase URL
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - Supabase anonymous key
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` - Supabase service role key
- `REPLICATE_API_TOKEN` - Replicate API token
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` - Public URL of your application

For detailed information about each environment variable, see `.env.example`.

### Google Credentials

For Google Cloud services (Vertex AI, Vision API), you need to handle the credentials file:

1. Generate a service account key from Google Cloud Console
2. For Vercel deployment, base64 encode the JSON file:
   ```bash
   cat google-credentials.json | base64
   ```
3. Store the encoded string in the `GOOGLE_CLOUD_VISION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable
4. The application automatically decodes this string during runtime
