> **⚠️ FEATURE REMOVAL NOTICE**: The "Create Images of You" feature has been removed from the application due to persistent technical issues causing page unresponsiveness and API reliability problems. This documentation is kept for historical and reference purposes only.

> We apologize for any inconvenience. You can still use our pre-trained models for image generation without any issues.

This guide describes the custom AI model creation feature that was previously available in the application.

## What You'll Need

- 10-20 high-quality photos of the person you want to create a model of
- The photos should be:
  - Clear and well-lit
  - Showing different angles of the face
  - Showing different expressions
  - Preferably with neutral backgrounds
- A ZIP file containing these photos (all common image formats are supported: JPG, PNG, etc.)

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Prepare Your Photos

1. Select 10-20 clear photos of the person
2. Make sure they show different angles and expressions
3. Compress them into a single ZIP file (using any compression tool)

### 2. Upload Your Photos

1. Navigate to the "Create Images of You" page from the sidebar
2. You'll see a drag-and-drop upload area in the center of the page
3. Drag your ZIP file onto this area, or click it to select a file from your computer
4. Wait for the file to upload and validate
5. If successful, you'll see a "File Validated" message

### 3. Name Your Model

1. In the "Model Name" field, enter a descriptive name for your model
   - Example: "John's Portrait Model" or "Sarah Summer 2024"
2. This name will be used to identify your model in the gallery

### 4. Start Training

1. Click the "Train Custom Model" button to begin the training process
2. You'll see a progress indicator showing the upload and training initialization
3. Once started, your model will appear in the "Your Models" panel with a "Training" status

### 5. Monitor Training Progress

1. The training process typically takes 15-20 minutes to complete
2. You can close the page and come back later - the training continues in the background
3. The status will automatically update from "Training" to "Ready" when complete

### 6. Using Your Trained Model

1. Once the model status shows "Ready", you can click the "Use" button
2. You'll be taken to the model's generation page
3. Enter prompts that include the model's trigger word (automatically generated)
   - Example: If your model is named "John", use prompts like "johnsmodel_person on a beach"
4. Generate images that feature the person you trained the model on

## Tips for Best Results

- **Photo Variety**: Include a good mix of closeups, half-body, and full-body shots
- **Consistent Lighting**: Photos with consistent, good lighting work best
- **Face Clarity**: Make sure the face is clearly visible in most photos
- **Expressions**: Include different expressions to create a versatile model
- **Unique Features**: Include photos that highlight unique characteristics

## Common Issues and Solutions

### "File Validation Failed"
- **Cause**: The ZIP file may contain non-image files or corrupted images
- **Solution**: Make sure your ZIP file only contains valid image files (JPG, PNG, etc.)

### "Training Failed"
- **Cause**: Issues with the training process or insufficient image quality
- **Solution**: Try again with higher quality images or a different selection of photos

### "Generated Images Don't Look Right"
- **Cause**: The model may need more varied training data
- **Solution**: Create a new model with more diverse photos showing different angles and lighting

## Privacy and Data Usage

- Your uploaded photos are used only for training your custom model
- The trained model is private to your account
- We recommend not using photos that contain sensitive or private information
