## Implementation Details

This feature uses Hugging Face's open-source AI models to analyze images. The implementation includes:

### API Endpoint

The `/api/analyze-image` endpoint processes image uploads and performs analysis using Hugging Face models:

```typescript
// src/app/api/analyze-image/route.ts
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server';
import axios from 'axios';

// Hugging Face API endpoints
const HF_API_URL = 'https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-large';
const HF_ENGAGEMENT_API_URL = 'https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/facebook/bart-large-mnli';

export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  // Process image with Hugging Face models
  // Return comprehensive analysis results with content pillar detection and platform-specific recommendations
}
```

### Hugging Face Integration

The analysis uses two key Hugging Face models:

1. **BLIP Image Captioning Model**: Generates detailed descriptions of image content
2. **BART-Large NLI Model**: Evaluates engagement potential based on image content

```typescript
// Getting image caption
async function getImageCaption(imageBuffer: Buffer, apiKey: string): Promise<string> {
  // Call Hugging Face BLIP model to generate caption
}

// Analyzing engagement potential
async function analyzeEngagement(caption: string, apiKey: string) {
  // Call Hugging Face BART model to evaluate engagement
}
```

### Enhanced Content Analysis

The improved analyzer now includes specialized content categorization logic:

```typescript
// Content pillar detection
if (lowerCaption.includes('performance') || lowerCaption.includes('professional') || 
    lowerCaption.includes('practice') || lowerCaption.includes('training') ||
    lowerCaption.includes('milestone') || lowerCaption.includes('achievement') ||
    lowerCaption.includes('behind the scenes') || lowerCaption.includes('work')) {
  pros.push('Professional excellence content (40% of ideal content mix) demonstrates expertise and creates aspirational connection');
}

// Platform-specific recommendations
if (platforms.includes('Instagram')) {
  platformAdvice += ' For Instagram, use 3-5 images in a carousel or create a Reel for 2x the reach.';
}
```

### User Interface

The upload interface in `PostUploadForm.tsx` provides a user-friendly way to analyze images before posting:

1. Upload an image
2. Click "Analyze for Social Media" 
3. Review data-driven analysis results with clear pros and cons
4. See content pillar categorization and platform-specific recommendations
5. Receive tailored posting time and caption advice
6. Proceed with posting
