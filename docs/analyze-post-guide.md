## Understanding the Analysis

The analysis provides several key insights:

### Safety Assessment
Vertex AI checks your image for content that might violate social media platform policies, including:
- Adult content
- Violence or graphic material
- Medical/disturbing imagery
- Inappropriate or racy content

### Content Analysis
The system identifies:
- Main subjects in the image
- Content categories (people, nature, food, etc.)
- Faces and expressions
- Potentially sensitive themes

### Engagement Potential
Based on extensive analysis of successful social media content, the system estimates:
- Likely engagement level (very low to very high)
- Content elements that might boost engagement
- Potential audience appeal

## Best Practices

For the best results:
- Use high-quality, well-lit images
- Ensure faces are clearly visible if featuring people
- Avoid text-heavy images as they analyze poorly
- Test different images to learn what generates higher engagement scores
- Follow the AI recommendations, but use your judgment too

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:
- Make sure your image is under 5MB
- Try images in JPG, PNG, or WebP formats
- If analysis fails, try a different image
- Refresh the page if the UI becomes unresponsive
