# Feature Updates

## Photo Editor - Outpainting Feature (Latest Update)

We've added a powerful new outpainting feature to the Photo Editor, allowing users to extend their images beyond the original boundaries:

1. **New "Outpaint" Tab in Photo Editor**
   - Extends images in any direction (top, bottom, left, right)
   - Seamlessly integrates with existing content
   - Powered by Stability AI's advanced image generation technology

2. **Implementation Details**
   - Uses Stability AI's specialized outpainting capabilities
   - Includes fallback mechanisms for reliability
   - Automatically extends canvas by approximately 50% in the chosen direction
   - Preserves style and content consistency with the original image

3. **How to Use**
   - Upload an image in the Photo Editor
   - Select the "Outpaint" tab
   - Choose a direction (top, bottom, left, right)
   - Optionally enter a custom prompt to guide the extension
   - Click "Apply Outpaint"

4. **Technical Implementation**
   - Primary method: Uses Stability AI's v2beta outpaint endpoint
   - Fallback method: Custom implementation using standard image-to-image endpoint
   - Detailed error handling and logging for reliability

This new feature expands the creative possibilities within the Photo Editor, allowing users to create extended scenes, add missing elements, or adjust composition without limitations of the original frame.

## Video Creation Features (Updated)

### Consolidated Video Creator Tab (Latest Update)

We've consolidated the video creation features in the application to provide a more streamlined user experience:

1. **Removed standalone "Longform Video" from the sidebar**
   - The feature is now integrated within the Video Creator tab
   - This reduces navigation clutter and provides a unified video creation experience

2. **Enhanced Video Creator Tab**
   - Now includes multiple options for video generation:
     - **Image to Video**: Convert still images to high-quality videos using Replicate's Wan 2.1 model
     - **Longform Video**: Generate comprehensive narrative videos from text descriptions using Hugging Face's stable-video-diffusion-img2vid-xt model
     - **Info & Help**: Detailed documentation for both video generation methods

3. **Technical Implementation**
   - Both video generation methods remain separate under the hood, using their respective AI models:
     - **Image to Video**: Uses Replicate's Wan 2.1 model (wavespeedai/wan-2.1-i2v-720p)
     - **Longform Video**: Uses Hugging Face's stabilityai/stable-video-diffusion-img2vid-xt model

4. **User Experience Improvements**
   - Unified interface with clear tabs for different video creation methods
   - Detailed documentation and help for each feature
   - Consistent styling and navigation

### How to Use

1. Navigate to the "Video Creator" tab in the sidebar
2. Choose between:
   - **Image to Video**: Upload an image and convert it to a video
   - **Longform Video**: Enter a text description to generate a narrative video
3. Follow the on-screen instructions for each feature

This update helps streamline the application's navigation while maintaining all video generation capabilities.
