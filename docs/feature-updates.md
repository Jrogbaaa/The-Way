# Feature Updates

## First-Time User Experience Improvements (Latest Update)

We've implemented a "try-before-you-sign-up" approach to improve the first-time visitor experience:

1. **Welcome Modal for New Visitors**
   - Added FirstTimeVisitorModal component with three main features:
     - **Create AI Images of You**: Direct access to the model creation page
     - **See What Works on Instagram**: Analytics for improving engagement
     - **Track Social Trends**: View trending content across platforms
   - Professional design with purple gradient background and improved text contrast
   - Clear call-to-action buttons for each feature

2. **Authentication Flow Improvements**
   - Modified middleware to allow unauthenticated access to key tool pages
   - Enabled relevant API routes for non-authenticated users
   - Trigger login prompts only after users experience value

3. **Implementation Details**
   - Homepage CTAs now open the welcome modal instead of redirecting to login
   - Created fully functional social-trends page accessible without login
   - Added query parameter handling to automatically open the model creation modal when accessed from the welcome screen

This "try-before-you-sign-up" approach follows best practices from services like Notion and Figma, allowing users to experience the product's value before creating an account.

## Backend System Improvements

We've made significant improvements to the AI model integration and styling system:

1. **Fixed Jaime Model API Integration**
   - Improved error handling for the Replicate API responses
   - Added proper polling mechanism with exponential backoff
   - Enhanced response format validation and fallback paths
   - Implemented the same successful pattern used for the Cristina model

2. **Tailwind CSS Configuration Updates**
   - Corrected shadow utility formatting in tailwind.config.js
   - Fixed shadow-sm utility class error
   - Updated the shadow configuration to ensure proper rendering of box-shadow styles
   - Improved consistency across all UI components

3. **New Photo Editor Basic Implementation**
   - Added initial PhotoEditor component
   - Implemented basic image upload functionality
   - Added image preview capabilities
   - Prepared foundation for upcoming filter and editing features

These technical improvements enhance reliability and consistency across the application, particularly for AI-powered features and UI styling.

## Photo Editor - Outpainting Feature

We've added a powerful new outpainting feature to the Photo Editor, allowing users to extend their images beyond the original boundaries:

1. **New "Outpaint" Tab in Photo Editor**
   - Extends images in any direction (top, bottom, left, right)
   - Seamlessly integrates with existing content
   - Powered by Stability AI's advanced image generation technology

2. **Implementation Details**
   - Uses Stability AI's specialized outpainting capabilities
   - Includes fallback mechanisms for reliability
   - Automatically extends canvas by approximately 50% in the chosen direction
   - Preserves style and content consistency with the original image

3. **How to Use**
   - Upload an image in the Photo Editor
   - Select the "Outpaint" tab
   - Choose a direction (top, bottom, left, right)
   - Optionally enter a custom prompt to guide the extension
   - Click "Apply Outpaint"

4. **Technical Implementation**
   - Primary method: Uses Stability AI's v2beta outpaint endpoint
   - Fallback method: Custom implementation using standard image-to-image endpoint
   - Detailed error handling and logging for reliability

This new feature expands the creative possibilities within the Photo Editor, allowing users to create extended scenes, add missing elements, or adjust composition without limitations of the original frame.

## Video Creation Features

### Consolidated Video Creator Tab

We've consolidated the video creation features in the application to provide a more streamlined user experience:

1. **Removed standalone "Longform Video" from the sidebar**
   - The feature is now integrated within the Video Creator tab
   - This reduces navigation clutter and provides a unified video creation experience

2. **Enhanced Video Creator Tab**
   - Now includes multiple options for video generation:
     - **Image to Video**: Convert still images to high-quality videos using Replicate's Wan 2.1 model
     - **Longform Video**: Generate comprehensive narrative videos from text descriptions using Hugging Face's stable-video-diffusion-img2vid-xt model
     - **Info & Help**: Detailed documentation for both video generation methods

3. **Technical Implementation**
   - Both video generation methods remain separate under the hood, using their respective AI models:
     - **Image to Video**: Uses Replicate's Wan 2.1 model (wavespeedai/wan-2.1-i2v-720p)
     - **Longform Video**: Uses Hugging Face's stabilityai/stable-video-diffusion-img2vid-xt model

4. **User Experience Improvements**
   - Unified interface with clear tabs for different video creation methods
   - Detailed documentation and help for each feature
   - Consistent styling and navigation

### How to Use

1. Navigate to the "Video Creator" tab in the sidebar
2. Choose between:
   - **Image to Video**: Upload an image and convert it to a video
   - **Longform Video**: Enter a text description to generate a narrative video
3. Follow the on-screen instructions for each feature

This update helps streamline the application's navigation while maintaining all video generation capabilities.
