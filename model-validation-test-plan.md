# Model Validation and Image Generation Test Plan

## 1. Testing Image Generation API Response Handling

### Test Case 1: Valid Model Generation
- **Action**: Send a request to `/api/modal/generate-image` with a valid model ID and prompt
- **Expected Result**: 
  - Status 200 with successful generation result
  - Image data in the response (either base64 or URL)
  - No error messages

### Test Case 2: Invalid/Corrupted Model
- **Action**: Send a request with a model ID known to be invalid or corrupted
- **Expected Result**:
  - Status 200 (since we're gracefully handling the error)
  - Response includes `usedPlaceholder: true` and `errorType: 'invalid_model'`
  - A placeholder image URL is returned
  - Clear error message explaining the model is corrupted
  - `modelError` property contains specific error details

### Test Case 3: Missing Python Dependencies
- **Action**: Send a request that would trigger a missing dependency error
- **Expected Result**:
  - Status 200 (since we're gracefully handling the error)
  - Response includes `usedPlaceholder: true` and `missingDependency: '<module-name>'`
  - A placeholder image URL is returned
  - Clear error message explaining which dependency is missing

### Test Case 4: Model Not Found
- **Action**: Send a request with a non-existent model ID
- **Expected Result**:
  - Status 200 (since we're gracefully handling the error)
  - Response indicates model not found
  - A placeholder image is returned
  - Error message explains the model doesn't exist or was deleted

## 2. Testing Frontend Error Handling

### Test Case 5: Display of Invalid Model Errors
- **Action**: Generate an image with an invalid model from the UI
- **Expected Result**:
  - Placeholder image is displayed
  - Error message about model corruption is shown
  - Suggestion to retrain the model is provided
  - "Train New Model" button is visible

### Test Case 6: Display of Missing Dependencies
- **Action**: Generate an image that triggers a missing dependency
- **Expected Result**:
  - Placeholder image is displayed
  - Error message about missing dependencies is shown
  - Message to contact administrator is visible

### Test Case 7: Handling Network Errors
- **Action**: Generate an image while network is unavailable
- **Expected Result**:
  - Appropriate error message displayed
  - UI handles the failure gracefully
  - Option to retry when network is available

## 3. Testing Model Validation Flow

### Test Case 8: Model Validation Before Training
- **Action**: Submit invalid model parameters (e.g., not enough images)
- **Expected Result**:
  - Validation catches the error
  - Clear error message displayed
  - Training doesn't start

### Test Case 9: Validation of Training Results
- **Action**: Check a model that failed during training
- **Expected Result**:
  - Model details page shows training error
  - Appropriate UI elements for error state
  - Option to retrain is provided

## 4. Testing Progress Tracking

### Test Case 10: Training Progress Display
- **Action**: Start model training and monitor progress
- **Expected Result**:
  - Progress bar updates in real-time
  - Current step and total steps are displayed
  - Percentage completion is accurate

## 5. System Health Checks

### Test Case 11: Python Environment Check
- **Action**: Run system health check for Python dependencies
- **Expected Result**:
  - List of required dependencies and their status
  - Clear indication of which dependencies are missing
  - Instructions for installing missing dependencies

## Test Execution Steps

1. Run `test-image-generation.js` to verify response formats
2. Manually test the UI for each test case
3. Check console logs for expected error messages
4. Verify placeholder images are displayed correctly
5. Confirm that validation errors are displayed properly to users
6. Ensure suggested actions (retrain model, contact admin) are appropriate

## Expected Outcomes

- All error states are handled gracefully
- Users receive clear feedback about what went wrong
- Placeholder images are shown instead of broken images
- The system suggests appropriate next steps for users
- No unhandled exceptions or UI crashes occur

## Additional Verification

- Check that analytics are still recorded even when errors occur
- Verify that error messages are clear and actionable
- Ensure that accessibility is maintained during error states
